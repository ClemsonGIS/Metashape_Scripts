# Metashape_Scripts
Contains Python and Bash Scripts to submit PBS Jobs on Clemson's Palmetto Cluster and process data on a network using Metashape.

The files contained in here are edited from the files in our PhotoScan_Scripts Repository, both repositories use the same instructional  document. The only difference is Metashape uses different algorithms for mesh generation than PhotoScan.
